### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) graduate, and my favoriate courses are [GIOS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems) and [Network Security](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6262-network-security).
Thanks to my **Computer Science** background, I've done some **interesting** building simulation:
* 08/2024, I have submitted two abstracts for [BuildingSimulation2025](https://bs2025.org/abstracts), one is about enhancing Urban Building Energy Modeling, another is about Model Predictive Control for Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).
* 09/2023, integrating heterogeneous urban microclimate modeling into Urban Building Energy Modeling (still powered through EnergyPlus engine) through [Message Passing Interface](https://github.com/xixihaha1995/MPI-WRF-EnergyPlus/tree/main) on [NCAR supercomputer](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history), [presented](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36195.53284) at conference.
* 10/2022, integrating homogeneous urban microclimate modeling into [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) through [semaphore](https://github.com/xixihaha1995/VCWG_EP_Scalar_Vector), [publised](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.111059).
* 7/2022, proposed one machine learning approach for predicting energy use of hydronic radiant slab system, presented at 7th International High Performance Buildings [Conference](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1413&context=ihpbc) at Purdue.
* 11/2021, contributed the energy simulation for one [reconfigurable building material](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.2c00419) that dynamically regulates radiative cooling and solar heat gain.
