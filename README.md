### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) graduate, and my favoriate courses are [GIOS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems) and [Network Security](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6262-network-security).
Thanks to my **Computer Science** background, I'm doing **interesting** building simulation:
1. integrating homogeneous urban microclimate into [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) through [semaphore](https://github.com/xixihaha1995/VCWG_EP_Scalar_Vector), [publised](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.111059).
2. integrating heterogeneous urban microclimate into Urban Building Energy Modeling (still powered through EnergyPlus engine) through [Message Passing Interface](https://github.com/xixihaha1995/MPI-WRF-EnergyPlus/tree/main) on [NCAR supercomputer](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history), [presented](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36195.53284) at conference.
